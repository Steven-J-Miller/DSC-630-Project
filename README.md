This project took a look the simple moving average crossover trading indicator. I wanted to backtest a large number of parameters across a wide basket of stocks to see if any particular indicators showed potential to deliver consistent profitable trading results.

The most-promising sets of parameters were then used to create a logistic regression that generates buy and sell signals based on the signals given by the indicators.
